## Overview

This repository provides essential information about ObMetrics, a free Shiny app designed to streamline the calculation of **outcomes** related to **Metabolic Syndrome** in **pediatric populations**. Please note, it is part of a manuscript that is being prepared for submission to a scientific journal. The app is in **beta**, and ongoing improvements are being made based on feedback from users.
